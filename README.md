## Capabilities
Wearable Device 2026 can receive mobile phone notifications, serve information (such as alerts, schematics), and capture photos & video. Wearable Device 2026 can also utilize bluetooth features -- like file transfer, connecting to accessories, and more. Handsfree use, navigation, and automation means that users no longer need to reach into your pocket, open up a computer, or check their smartwatch for information. It all delivers via the high-resolution Sony Display that Wearable Device 2026 is equipped with. This will serve occupational uses well, such as factory workers seeing a schematic right in front of them, disaster responders getting critical alerts in their field-of-view, or even researchers using the device for education. Wearable Device 2026 is a purpose-driven device built to serve us, not serve us gimmicks. Wearable Device 2026 aims to be a truly useful device, and the best student-built wearable, all built with off-the-shelf parts. Wearable Device 2026 is being actively developed for University of Cincinnati's Senior Design Capstone 2026 round, and the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2026 International Competition.
